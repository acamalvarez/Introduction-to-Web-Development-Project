# Introduction-to-Web-Development-Project
This is the project I made for the course on coursera.org Introduction to Web Development.

This form is for a teacher who needs to submit a student's grades for a school. In consists of a registration number, which must have 7 digits (according to the school registration). The grades (Mid-term 1, Mid-term 2, assignment, and final) need to be between 0-5. For the assignment date, if it was delivered after the due date, it subtracts 0.1 points from the final grade. The checkboxes are for giving additional points. If the students attended all the lectures and made an optional presentation, they will obtain 0.1 and 0.2 additional points, respectively.The final grade is also restricted to 0-5.
